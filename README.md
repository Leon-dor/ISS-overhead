This code is designed to track the position of the International Space Station (ISS) and send you an email when the ISS is overhead and it’s night time outside.

is_iss_overhead(): This function checks if the ISS is currently overhead.
It does this by making a request to the “http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json” API, which returns the current latitude and longitude of the ISS.
If the ISS’s position is within +5 or -5 degrees of your location, the function returns True.
is_night(): This function checks if it’s currently night time at your location.
It makes a request to the “https://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json” API, which returns the times of sunrise and sunset for your location.
If the current time is after sunset or before sunrise, the function returns True.
The while True: loop: This loop runs indefinitely.
Every 60 seconds (due to time.sleep(60)), it checks if the ISS is overhead and if it’s night time.
If both conditions are met, it sends an email to the address specified in MY_EMAIL with the subject “Look Up👆” and the message “The ISS is above you in the sky.”
